============

**** Version 3 of Dart & Henson is gonna be released soon in January 2018. If you are looking for the README page of Dart & Henson 2, please visit [this wiki page](https://github.com/f2prateek/dart/wiki/Dart-&-Henson-v2-).****

**** This page is under construction until version 3 is released. ****

## Summary 
Extra "binding" library & intent builders for Android. Dart & Henson (DH) uses annotation processing to bind intent's extras to pojo fields, and to generate intent builders via a fluent API.

## Description of DH 3
Dart and Henson is a an Android Library that structures the navigation layer of your apps. It helps to create intents and consume them in a structured way. We believe it's the best way to organize your navigation layer, and make it less error-prone and easier to maintain.

It is composed of 2 components: Dart and Henson. Both of them use annotated classes that describe the parameters (extras of the intent) of a target activity. DH3 is not easy to setup manually, and we strongly encourage to use the gradle henson-plugin that we provide to use it. See the [samples](https://github.com/f2prateek/dart/tree/master/dart-sample) for more details.

## Navigation models

A navigation model class is a simple pojo with annotated non private fields. The fields describe an extra passed to the target of an intent:
```java
@DartModel
public class MyActivityNavigationModel {
  //a simple requested field, it's name is used as the extra key
  public String extra1;
  //a named field using an annotation
  public @BindExtra(MY_CONSTANT_NAME) String extra2;
  //an optional field
  public @Nullable MyParcelableOrSerializable extra3;
}
```

Note that in DH3, navigation models:
* are mandatory, it's not possible to annotate activities directly.
* must follow a naming convention: they should have the same fully qualified name as the activity or service they describe the navigation of, plus the suffix: `NavigationModel`. (e.g.: `com.foo.wooper.app.MyActivityNavigationModel`).
* must be placed in the navigation source set: in `src/navigation/main/java`.

## Dart

The historical first component of the library is used to map intents to Pojos (navigation models). Typically, a target activity will define a navigation model class, a pojo with annotated fields and will map the intents it receives to an instance of its model: 
```java
public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
  Dart.bind(this, myNavigationModel)
}
```

An activity (or a service) can map the extras of the intent it receives, or a bundle like `savedInstanceState`.

## Henson

The second component of the library is used to create intents. Based on the navigation model, henson will create an intent builder for the described class (remember the name of the activity / service can be dedudced from the FQN of the model). It creates also some useful wrapper around them, see below.

Generally speaking, Intent Builders generated by Henson are not used directly, but via the `HensonNavigator` class that is generated for each module.

#### The HensonNavigator Class

The `HensonNavigator` is generated on a usage basis: it wraps all the intent builder that a module can use.
```java
Intent intent = HensonNavigator.gotoMyActivity(context)
 .extra1("foo")
 .extra2(42)
 .extra3(myObj) //optional
 .build();
```

The intent builders used by a module are detected automatically during the build, based on the dependencies a module uses, and the `HensonNavigator` is generated accordingly.


## What's new in DH3 ?

Briefly:
* DH3 fully supports modularization. It was the main motivation for the version 3, and it requested quite a few changes. We don't have a migration guide yet.
* navigation models have changed and are mandatory, they need a single annotation: `@DartModel`.
* navigation models must follow a naming convention
* they must be placed in a different source set in: `src/navigation/main/java`
* DH3 offers a gradle plugin. DH3 uses a lot of annotation processing internally, configurations, source sets, artifacts, custom tasks. Do not set it up manually unless you know gradle well.
* annotations have changed, the new model is simpler.
* DH3 classes have been repackaged. Though, unfortunately, we couldn't rename the groupId of the library, and gradle doesn't let you use DH2 and DH3 simultaneously.


ProGuard
--------

If ProGuard is enabled be sure to add these rules to your configuration:

```
-dontwarn dart.internal.**
-keep class **__ExtraBinder { *; }
-keepclasseswithmembernames class * {
    @dart.* <fields>;
}
-keep class **Henson { *; }
-keep class **__IntentBuilder { *; }
-keep class **HensonNavigator { *; }

#if you use it
#see Parceler's github page
#for specific proguard instructions
```

Download
--------

Dart:
```groovy
implementation 'com.f2prateek.dart:dart:(insert latest version)'
annotationProcessor 'com.f2prateek.dart:dart-processor:(insert latest version)'
```
Henson :
```groovy
implementation 'com.f2prateek.dart:henson:(insert latest version)'
annotationProcessor 'com.f2prateek.dart:henson-processor:(insert latest version)'
```

Kotlin
-----
For all Kotlin enthusiasts, you may wonder how to use this library to configure your intents. This is perfectly compatible, with a bit of understanding of how Kotlin works, especially when it comes to annotation processing.

Assuming that your project is already configured with Kotlin, update your `build.gradle` file :

```groovy
apply plugin: 'kotlin-kapt'

dependencies {
  implementation 'com.f2prateek.dart:henson:(insert latest version)'
  kapt 'com.f2prateek.dart:henson-processor:(insert latest version)'
}
```

Now you can use `@InjectExtra` annotation to generate either non-null or nullables properties :

```kotlin
class ExampleActivity : Activity() {
  @InjectExtra
  lateinit var title: String

  @InjectExtra
  var titleDefaultValue: String = "Default Title"

  @Nullable
  @JvmField
  @InjectExtra
  var titleNullable: String? = null

  override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
      super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
      setContentView(R.layout.simple_activity)
      Dart.inject(this)
      // TODO Use "injected" extras...
  }
}
```

Note that you still need to use the Java `@Nullable` annotation otherwise Henson won't interpret your property as nullable and will generate a builder with a mandatory field (even though you declared your property as nullable with the "?" Kotlin marker). Finally, you have to add the `@JvmField` annotation or your compiler will complain about not having a backing field.

You may need to add an argument to your `build.gradle` file if your activities and fragments are located in different packages as mentioned above. The Kotlin syntax with **kapt** is :

```groovy
kapt {
    arguments {
        arg("dart.henson.package", "your.package.name")
    }
}
```

Finally, if you are using Parceler that comes built-in with this library, the syntax does not change from Java, except when dealing with **data** classes. Because Parceler requires a default constructor with no argument, here is how you need to declare your **data** class :

```kotlin
@Parcel(Parcel.Serialization.BEAN)
data class ParcelExample @ParcelConstructor constructor(
        val id: Int,
        val name: String,
        ...
}
```
